This folder contains binary files compiled for SCAPE Version 1.21 together with a 
standard library in the "libs" folder.

These are compiled with Plato version 4.63 from Silverfrost:
===============================================================

CREATE_FILES.exe - the supporting application that creates the model.omi and model.fcs files 
required to describe a SCAPE model component to FluidEarth

ENGINE.dll - the SCAPE engine

SCAPE.exe - the free-standing SCAPE application 

================================================

Engine_Wrapper.dll - the SCAPE engine wrapper required by FluidEarth

The libs Folder
===============

Contains a library taken from a Plato version 4.63 installation. 
This is provided for convenience and if to be used must be copied to a folder listed 
on the Windows PATH.

Reccomendation is that you do not use this library but instead install Plato by Silverfrost.
